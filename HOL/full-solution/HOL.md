# Introduction to Building Windows Store Apps with Microsoft Azure Mobile Services #

---
<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##
In this HOL, you will create a Mobile, Logic, API and Web App as part of an integrated solution.  The Mobile App will connect to a SQL Database instance and store Todo items in the database.  The Logic App will poll the database for new records and start a workflow instance for each new table record.  The API App will be used in the Logic App to store workflow data to an DocumentDB instance.  Finally, the Web App will host a WebJob that asynchronously notifies you when a workflow has finished processing data.

<a name="Objectives"></a>
### Objectives ###
- Create a Logic App workflow using both API Apps and built-in connectors
- Create a Mobile App instance and integrate the service with a Windows Store application
- Create a custom API App instance and use it in a Logic App
- Create a WebJob hosted in a Web App instance.

2. Type a unique **Name** for your Mobile App..

7. Select any **Location**. In this tutorial, we used **South Central US**.

3. Select your subscription.

6. Create a new App Service Plan with the name **EndToEnd** for your App Service apps.  Ensure that the App Service Plan is at the **S1 Standard** pricing tier.

4. Create a new resource group with the name **EndToEnd** for your App Service apps.

  > You must create a new App Service Plan in order to have the option to create a new resource group.  Please ensure that you create a new plan and resource group that are unique for this lab.  This lab will assume that you use the name **EndToEnd** for both your plan and group.

5. In **Package Settings**, select **USERDATABASE**, you can choose an existing database or create a new one. For creating a new database, type the name of the new **database**, create a new **server**, type the name of that server, then choose a **login name**, which is the administrator login name for the new SQL Database server, type and confirm the password, and click the ok button to complete the process. If selecting an existing database, you will need to provide a **Server Administrator Password**.

This is a Windows Universal App project using XAML and C# that's already preconfigured to connect to your Mobile App.  The other project will have an suffix of **_Runtime**.  This project represents the app code for the Mobile App itself.

> You may need to unblock the compressed files (zip) since they were downloaded from the internet.

2. Open the **Runtime** solution in Visual Studio.

3. Open the **DataObjects/TodoItem** file.

4. Within the existing namespace, replace the entire **TodoItem** class with the following code:

  > It is important that you keep the namespace intact as the namespace will vary if you used a different name for your project.

        using Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server;

        public class TodoItem : EntityData
        {
            public string Text { get; set; }

            public bool Complete { get; set; }
